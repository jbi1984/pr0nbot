Changelog:


Version 1.0.2:

  * Removed all os.chdir() calls - one more step towards Jython compatibility!


Version 1.0.1:

  * Merged checkconfig() and getconfig(). Now getconfig() does everything 
  (much nicer).
  
  * Renamed default_ignore to default_config. Maybe we'll put something else
  besides the ignore list in the config file in the future.

  * Replaced cPickle with pickle. We are not working with massive amounts of 
  data anyway, so we can stick with the Python version. Maybe this will make
  it work on Mac (or even Jython, who knows).
  
  * getpr0n() is now ALWAYS called with aggro=True for image downloads, 
  even with regular spidering.
  

Version 1.0:

  * Initial release.
